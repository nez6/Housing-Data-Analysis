The goal of this repository is to understand economic data and factors to understand what is causing the struggle with buying a home. 

To understand current trends, I will be looking at the following variables: 
	
Housing Market:
  
-	Mortgage Interest Rates - using the FRED (Federal Reserve Bank from St. Louis), we were able to pull the mortgage rate data. There is likely less bias in this data as the data was published daily to the public. (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US)

-	Treasury Bonds (10 Years) - using the FRED (Federal Reserve Bank from St. Louis), we were able to pull the mortgage rate data. There is likely less bias in this data as the data was published daily to the public.
